Created by Harsh Sharma
This repository contains sql project from my Udacity Nanodegree - Programming For Data Science Using Python.


Overview :
This project required to explore movie rentals database provided by Udacity.
In which I had to write efficient SQL queries and build meaningful visualizations involving answers to some questions of descriptive statistics.

For the powerpoint presentation :
I had to create four slides with pre-defined criterias involing:
           (1) a question of interest
		   (2) a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question
		   (3) a supporting visualization created using the final data of the SQL queries that answers the questions of interest.
		   (4) a small summary on each slide.
		   (5) all questions should involve descriptive statistics

Project 2
Overview
In this project, the student had to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The student had to write code to (a) import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and (b) write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Project Submission
The developed CLI program allows the user to explore an US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. The user is able filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data. The user is also able to chose to view raw data and to sort this data by columns, in ascending or descending order.
