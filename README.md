This repository contains sql project from my Udacity Nanodegree - Programming For Data Science Using Python.


Overview :
This project required to explore movie rentals database provided by Udacity.
In which I had to write efficient SQL queries and build meaningful visualizations involving answers to some questions of descriptive statistics.

For the powerpoint presentation :
I had to create four slides with pre-defined criterias involing:
           (1) a question of interest
		   (2) a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question
		   (3) a supporting visualization created using the final data of the SQL queries that answers the questions of interest.
		   (4) a small summary on each slide.
		   (5) all questions should involve descriptive statistics
